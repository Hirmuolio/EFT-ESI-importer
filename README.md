# EFT-ESI-importer

This script will import your character skills and implants from ESI api and save them for EFT to use.
Place the scripts in characters folder in your EFT installation.

There are two versions of the script:
*  	`EFT_ESI_importer.py` is the full version that you should use first.
*  	`fast_EFT_ESI_importer.py` skips all the configuring steps and runs the importing without asking anything. You need to use the full version first to register and log in.

Requirements: 
* Python 3.6 or newer
* Requests http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
